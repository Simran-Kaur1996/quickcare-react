## 👨‍💻 What I Did

✅ Built a responsive **React.js** frontend for patient self-check-in  
✅ Created a **serverless backend** using **AWS Lambda** & **API Gateway**  
✅ Integrated with **DynamoDB** to securely store patient records  
✅ Containerized the app using **Docker**  
✅ Deployed to **Amazon EKS** with **LoadBalancer** for public access  
✅ Set up end-to-end **CI/CD via GitHub Actions**
